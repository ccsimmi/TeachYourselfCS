# Intro
I've set up this repository to record and track my studies within computer science. As of writing (Nov 08 2023), I am a full stack junior web developer with just over two years of experience. I found [Teach yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) a while back. I also want to do great work in my career, to take risks and create products that millions of users will utilise. Yes, right now, I am pretty good at creating fantastic user experiences, but there is so much more to learn. I am super interested in maybe, writing my own language one day, or creating a game engine, or anything extremely hard that will make many people tell me: "don't bother! Use an existing solution". But someone had to write the first solution, right? Anyhow, I love to learn and I love to program. Truthfully, I do find programming and logic difficult, but I make up for my lack of genius with a good work ethic. I hope this document details my recorded studies and that I can reflect back in the future and see how my hardwork got me to where I am today. So, let's begin!

## Languages
These are not part of the [Teach yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) but just languages I would like to learn and play around with
